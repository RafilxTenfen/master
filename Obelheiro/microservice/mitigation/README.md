- Code generation at runtime ?

- Our mechanism works by performing risk analysisagainst microservices to detect and prioritize vulnerabilities.Thereafter, security risk-oriented software diversification is em-ployed, guided by a defineddiversification index. The diversifica-tion is performed at runtime, leveraging both model and templatebased automatic code generation techniques to automaticallytransform programming languages and container images of themicroservices. Consequently, the microservices attack surfacesare altered thereby introducing uncertainty for attackers whilereducing theattackabilityof the microservices.
