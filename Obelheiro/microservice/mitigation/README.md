### A Cyber Risk Based Moving Target DefenseMechanism for Microservice Architectures

- Kennedy A. Torkura∗, Muhammad I.H. Sukmana∗, Anne V.D.M. Kayem‡,Feng Cheng∗, Christoph Meine

- Code generation at runtime ?

- Our mechanism works by performing risk analysisagainst microservices to detect and prioritize vulnerabilities.Thereafter, security risk-oriented software diversification is em-ployed, guided by a defineddiversification index. The diversifica-tion is performed at runtime, leveraging both model and templatebased automatic code generation techniques to automaticallytransform programming languages and container images of themicroservices. Consequently, the microservices attack surfacesare altered thereby introducing uncertainty for attackers whilereducing theattackabilityof the microservices.

### Sandnet: Towards High Quality of Deception inContainer-based Microservice Architectures

-  measure  the  Quality  of  Deception  (QoD)  anduse it to evaluate three proposed network deception mechanisms.Our  evaluation  results  indicate  that  in  our  evaluation  scenarioin  best  case,  an  optimal  QoD  is  achieved.


### Conversa

- Trabalho com proposta fundamentada para refinar a pesquisa

- Moving target

- Most, if not all, proposals for mitigation are Moving Target Defense-based solutions (MTD) [68]. The idea behindMTD is to continuously perform transformation of system components and configurations preventing attackers fromacquiring knowledge about target systems to be used to initiate harmful attacks.  This includes, periodically updateor restart microservices, IP shuffling, and live migration of microservices. Specifically, the authors of P21 proposeddeception through live cloning and sandboxing of suspicious containers respecting the same network overloading andperformance to deceive attackers .
